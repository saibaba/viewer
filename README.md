# viewer

Following are implemented.

naive
-----
A naive OO system using GType but nothing else from GObject - we essentially create a new fundamental type than using GObject as base class and hence loose all of its power.


minimal
----
A minimal implementation of Viewer that uses built in macros.

verbose
-----
An implementation of Viewer that does not use built-in macros. Just opening the hood of GObject system a a little to understand it better.
